# Texts for Learning a Language with the Birkenbihl Method
Foreign language texts are presented in several different forms:

1. The original text paragraph by paragraph (currently all texts here are in Bulgarian)
2. Translated text paragraph by paragraph (currently all translations are in English)
3. Transcribed original text paragraph by paragraph into spoken language (click the *play* button to start▶️/stop⏹ the audio)
4. The original text word by word
5. Translated text word by word: Below each original word its translation is placed. This is one of the main aspects of the Birkenbihl method.
